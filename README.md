# Evaluating the Impact of an Education Policy in K-12 in Kazakhstan using Econometric Methods
**Abstract:**  A mountain of evidence proves the importance and significant positive effect of education on one’s life. More specifically, it leads to higher income, longer life expectancy, and better health, and for women, it leads to lower birth rates and higher female autonomy. The preliminary research in Kazakhstan has shown that females pursue the least-paid professions despite females' higher education attainment rates in Kazakhstan. Additionally, a significant amount of evidence suggests a drastic difference between the quality of education received in urban and rural areas. In the international arena, Kazakhstani students score lower than OECD’s average on international tests (PISA, TIMSS), with an overall declining average score over time. The Ministry of Education has been responding with multiple reforms in the past decade and continuous attempts to increase the quality of education. However, there has been almost no impact evaluation conducted by independent researchers on the policies and many programs initiated by the Ministry. To address this challenge, I begin to investigate the current state of education in Kazakhstan and focus on the change in the funding of K-12, piloted in 2014 in collaboration with UNICEF. To evaluate the impact of the policy, I conduct several experiments on two cities in Kazakhstan (Almaty and Astana) using synthetic control and difference-in-differences methods.
